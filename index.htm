A demonstration of some of the things I have learned at the beginning of this coding journey
by copcasui aka shallot aka Charlotte E.
Thank you freeCodeCamp and The Coding Train for the bulk of what I've learned,
as well as w3schools, stackoverflow and other online sources available for helping in quick google searches.

<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
If you have stumbled here, then I welcome you. I also welcome you if you chose to come here on purpose. On this page
 I'll be talking who I am, my interest and current experience in coding, and a bit about my aspirations. Throughout this process 
 I will be showing what I have learned so far (mostly HTML/CSS) and will be using this page as a testing area. Feel free to leave 
 me some feedback (todo: insert a form).
