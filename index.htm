A demonstration of some of the things I have learned at the beginning of this coding journey
by copcasui aka shallot aka Charlotte E.
Thank you freeCodeCamp and The Coding Train for the bulk of what I've learned,
as well as w3schools, stackoverflow and other online sources available for helping in quick google searches.

<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>
If you have stumbled here, then I welcome you. I also welcome you if you chose to come here on purpose. On this page
 I'll be talking who I am, my interest and current experience in coding, and a bit about my aspirations. Throughout this process I will be showing what I have learned so far (mostly HTML/CSS) and will be using this page as a testing area. Feel free to leave me some feedback (todo: insert a form).

 <h2>About me</h2>
 I'm Charlotte, a coding newbie from Montreal, Canada. I grew up in Quebec and moved to the UK in late 2017. My hobbies include fashion/sowing, drawing, and languages. I'm bilingual (FR/EN) and I've previously studied Russian, German, and Chinese (mandarin),  although I am nowhere near fluent in any. I am currently taking a break from languages to focus on coding, but eventually I hope to be fluent in a third language. I also enjoy reading, anything ethereal, cheesecake, traveling, and astrology (for those interested, I'm a Cancer sun, Scorpio moon).
